## Urban Planning

To run the different urban planning variations, simply run them via your python3 install.

The program requires two arguments to run properly.
The first is the path to the input file containing the number of zones to place and the cost map
The second is the word `genetic` or `hill` to choose which mode to use. Please use those exact words, all lowercase.

For example, to run the file with Hill Climbing, using an input file in the same directory, run this command:

`python3 urban_planning_main.py inputFile.txt hill`
