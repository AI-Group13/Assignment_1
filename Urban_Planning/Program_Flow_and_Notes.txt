Generate board heuristics for each kind of zone (will be constant for all iterations of placement)

Generate k number of empty boards (genetics) or one board (hill climb)

Genetics:
    Randomly assign given number of each zone
    Determine score

    Preserve N number/percent of the best (Elitism)

    Kill off M number/percent of the worst (Culling)

    Selection (two boards)
        Keep Elite with Elite? Mix Elite with Chaff?
        "Weight towards higher fitness" - Ignore Chaff???

    Crossover
        Where to split?

    Mutation
        Remove a zone, add it back somewhere else (random?)
        Don't mutate Elite

    How to get back lost boards?
        After culling currently number stays static
        Use Elite multiple times?
        Mutate and keep original?

Hill Climb
    Okay for now. Will have questions later



NOTES:

Boards are stored as Board[Y][X], a list of rows, with each row being a list of spaces in that row
