README for N Queens Problem 

The n-Queens problem solved using two approaches - Greedy Hill Climbing with Restarts AND A* search.

1. HILL CLIMBING 

a. Refer to the Hill Climbing folder - This folder contains the code for "Greedy Hill Climbing with Random Restarts" approach to the solution

b. Description of the individual files 
	input.txt		 - Contains two lines to be fed as input 
					Line 1: Grid size (Integer)
					Line 2: Visualization condition for the result - 1 for YES and 0 for NO - (Integer)

	nQueens.py 		- Contains the various helper functions for pygame based visualization, heuristic calculation and move checking
	nQueens_main.py		- Runs required algorithm based on the input file entries
	nQueens_HillClimb.py 	- Greedy Hill Climb with random restarts Algorithm implementation

c. Required python libraries and packages - Codes shall work on Python3
		
	pygame -  (Install via Synaptic Package manager), time, random, math, sys,

2. A* Search

a. Refer to the A-Star folder - This folder contains the code for "A* search" approach to the solution

b. Description of the individual files 
	input.txt		 - Contains two lines to be fed as input 
					Line 1: Grid size (Integer)
					Line 2: Visualization condition for the result - 1 for YES and 0 for NO - (Integer)

	nQueens.py 		- Contains the various helper functions for pygame based visualization, heuristic calculation 					and move checking
	nQueens_main.py		- Runs required algorithm based on the input file entries
	astar.py 		- Greedy Hill Climb with random restarts Algorithm implementation
