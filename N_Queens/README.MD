The n-Queens problem solved using two approaches -  Greedy Hill Climbing with Restarts AND A* search 

1. input.txt - Contains two lines -   Line 1: Grid size
                                      Line 2: Algorithm to be used - 1 for A* and 2 for Hill Climbing
                                      
2. nQueens.py - Contains helper function for pygame based visualization and heuristic calculation

3. nQueens_main.py  - Runs required algorithm based on the input file entries
 
4. nQueens_HillClimb.py - Greedy Hill Climb with random restarts Algorithm implementation
