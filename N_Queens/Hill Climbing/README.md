The n-Queens problem solved using two approaches - Greedy Hill Climbing with Restarts AND A* search

1. input.txt - Contains two lines - Line 1: Grid size Line 2: Visualization wanted or not 

2. nQueens.py - Contains helper function for pygame based visualization and heuristic calculation

3. nQueens_main.py - Runs required algorithm based on the input file entries

4. nQueens_HillClimb.py - Greedy Hill Climb with random restarts Algorithm implementation
